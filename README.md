# Grow Kitty

## Overview
Grow Kitty is an open-source habit management application designed to enhance user motivation through gamification.  
By integrating daily random missions, rewards, and a virtual cat that reacts to user performance, the application encourages consistent habit formation in an interactive and engaging way.  

The project aims to address the limitations of traditional habit-tracking applications, which often lack emotional engagement and user participation. Grow Kitty provides a system where users can maintain daily habits while observing the growth of their virtual cat.
